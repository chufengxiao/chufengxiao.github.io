Hi, I am currently a Ph.D. student at School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong (CityU), supervised by [Prof. Hongbo Fu](http://sweb.cityu.edu.hk/hongbofu/). 
Prior to this, I obtained my B.E. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology (SCUT), in June 2019, supervised by [Prof. Shengfeng He](http://www.shengfenghe.com/).

My research interests include **Computer Graphics** (CG) and **Human-computer Interaction** (HCI). Specifically, I mainly focus on **controllable AIGC**, striving to create a interactive CG system for content generation and manipulation which can be controlled by users. My research has been featured in top-tier conferences and journals, including *SIGGRAPH (Asia), ACM TOG, IEEE TVCG, ACM CHI, IEEE TMM, CGF,* etc. Recently, my research works include sketch-based image synthesis and editing, and sketch-based 3D reconstruction. Please refer to my [publication page](https://chufengxiao.github.io/publications/) for more details. 

I am open to discuss any research ideas, collaborations, and job opportunities! You may reach me at \
