Hi, I am currently a researcher at Huawei Noah‚Äôs Ark Lab, Huawei Hong Kong Research Center (HKRC). Prior to this, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong (CityU), supervised by [Prof. Hongbo Fu](https://hongbofu.people.ust.hk/) in June 2024, and B.E. degree from School of Computer Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology (SCUT), in June 2019, supervised by [Prof. Shengfeng He](http://www.shengfenghe.com/). I was lucky to work with [Prof. Wenhan Luo](https://whluo.github.io/) and [Prof. Yike Guo](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/yikeguo) as a Post-doctoral Fellow at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

My research interests include **Computer Graphics** (CG) and **Human-computer Interaction** (HCI). Specifically, I mainly focus on **controllable AIGC**, striving to create an interactive CG system for content generation and manipulation, which can be controlled by users. My research has been featured in top-tier conferences and journals, including *SIGGRAPH (Asia), ACM TOG, IEEE TVCG, ACM CHI, IEEE TMM, CGF,* etc. Recently, my research works include sketch-based image synthesis and editing, and sketch-based 3D reconstruction. Please refer to my [publication page](https://chufengxiao.github.io/publications/) for more details.
